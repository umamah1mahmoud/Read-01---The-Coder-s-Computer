Choosing a text editor for web  development  can be really  flexible  since many text editors serve the same main and core purpose. However, they might vary in some features that some developers find more desirable while they are writing their codes. Very basic editors are ones that are already installed on Mac or Windows running computers. They pretty much serve the main purpose but lack some more advanced features. Some other advanced text third-party editors are Notepad++, TextWrangler, BBEdit, VisualStudioCode, Atom, Brackets and SublimeText.

So what exactly a command line is? It's a text based interface to the system using terminal. When you enter commands in terminal, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. It's full shortcuts for the commands to make the process easier for the developer.

Once you've started using terminal on certain directory you shall not panic of not having clue about where are you at. Terminal has the right set of commands to help you either know what is the path of your current directory, or list for you the contents of the directory you're working on. The listing also has more advanced commands to help you show more information about the content or even sometimes show your hidden items that you may not see in your graphic interface.

Linux makes it easier with considering everything as a file. Yes! everything, even directories or "folders" as you may know them are considered a type of file. this makes the whole process easier to deal with. It is however a case sensitive, which means you must be ware of any typos because it's not will be running.

I hope this helped you having a brief look and keywords if you found yourself interested in further research.
